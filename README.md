I like to give my video game characters interesting names, and most name
generators come up with such boring stuff.  There are some pretty funky names
of people and places in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament, so I figured
I might as well leverage those.

`extract.rb` pulls out what it thinks are names from the text of the Bible, as
recorded in the [New Heart English Bible][NHEB] (NHEB).  The NHEB was primarily
chosen because [it is available][NHEB-2] as one large plaintext file, while
most other public-domain Bibles are only available in HTML, often
chapter-by-chapter.
